## Motivation Behind Kodi

Cable/Satellite services for Television broadcasting has been in a decline since the introduction of popular streaming apps such as Netflix and Hulu. Some TV manufacturers have introduced SmartTVs with few of these streaming apps pre-built. Along with the growth of SmartTVs came along streaming devices such as Google's Chromecast, Apple TV, and Roku.

Kodi is an open-source entertainment hub that is customizable and available on various devices and operating systems. This includes Microsoft Windows, Apple OSX and iOS, Android, Linux, and Raspberry Pi. Kodi uses a lot when it comes to streaming from added-on streaming apps (i.e. Netflix and Hulu), a media server, live-TV apps, etc. However, with the variety of uses on Kodi, there are diverse point of security that should be considered. How is financial information secured if the user has a paid subscription to Netflix? Is any data collected from the user's streaming/viewing habits? How is information communicated when using the Internet for various tasks? These are the types of questions the project members would want to look into further and look for any flaws.
