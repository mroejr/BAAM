This time around, it was difficult to find time to meet together as a group to fully access and delegate tasks for the other group members. The Thanksgiving break, along with the holiday season in general, were the main reasons for this issue. In addition, we group members had difficulty in finding and implementing different analysis tools available for public use to access the Kodi software and other relevant libraries. Trial and error was needed, but we can all agree that the effort helped us learn. Our individual members tried their best for this deliverable, and hope to wrap things up well for the upcoming presentation.
